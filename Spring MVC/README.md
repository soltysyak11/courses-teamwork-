## Set Up DB
If you want to configure and fill your DB automaticly you need to create 'todolist' DB on your server and set properties 
- spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
- spring.datasource.initialization-mode=always
in **application.properties** file

When application starts your DB will be filled data from data.sql file from resources folder

There are three users with ADMIN and USER roles in DB.

| Login         | Password | Role  |
| ------------- |:--------:|:-----:|
| mike@mail.com | 1111     | ADMIN |
| nick@mail.com | 2222     | USER  |
| nora@mail.com | 3333     | USER  |

User with Admin role has access to all data and resources in DB
